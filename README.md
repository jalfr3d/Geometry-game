# Geometry Game - Python

## Overview

This Python-based geometry game is a fun and interactive way to learn about points, rectangles, and geometric concepts. The game generates a random rectangle and challenges the player to guess whether a given point is inside the rectangle and to estimate the area of the rectangle. It's a great tool for improving geometry knowledge while having fun.

## Features

- **Random Rectangle**: A random rectangle is generated for each game session with random coordinates.

- **Point Guess**: Players can guess whether a given point is inside the rectangle.

- **Area Estimation**: Players can estimate the area of the rectangle.

- **Visual Representation**: The game provides a visual representation of the rectangle and the guessed point on a canvas using the Turtle graphics library.

## How It Works

1. Run the script using Python.

2. The game generates a random rectangle with random coordinates.

3. The player is prompted to guess a point's X and Y coordinates.

4. The player is prompted to estimate the area of the rectangle.

5. The game provides feedback on whether the point is inside the rectangle and calculates the difference between the estimated and actual rectangle area.

6. The visual representation of the rectangle and the guessed point is displayed using Turtle graphics.

7. The player can continue to play as many rounds as desired.

## Prerequisites

Before playing the game, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.

- The Turtle graphics library, which is included in Python's standard library.

## Notes

- This game is designed to be both entertaining and educational, making it suitable for students, learners, and anyone interested in geometry.

- The game provides immediate feedback, allowing players to test their geometry knowledge and learn from their guesses.

- You can modify the game by changing the random generation parameters, such as the range of coordinates for the rectangle.

- Feel free to enhance the game by adding more features or levels for a more challenging experience.

That's it! Have fun playing the Geometry Game and improving your geometry skills while enjoying an interactive experience.
